Those 2 XMLs will add in the following systems
- Gameboy Hacks (`gbh`)
- Gameboy Color Hacks (`gbch`)
- Gameboy Advance Hacks (`gbah`)
- Genesis Hacks (`genh`)
- NES Hacks (`nesh`)
- SNES Hacks (`snesh`)
- Switch (`switch`)

They are to be placed in `ES-DE/custom_systems` (Download them and copy/paste them into that directory, make sure you don't have them end as `.txt`, they _have_ to be `.xml`).
After adding the custom system files make sure to fully close ES-DE and restart it for the custom system files to load (not just rescan roms).


Why the hacks folders? I come from JelOS and these folders were present, art-book-next-es-de also has support for those now. **This also means other themes may just display a generic image for hacks**
